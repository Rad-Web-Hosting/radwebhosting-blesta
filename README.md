## About
This is a custom Blesta module built for our resellers to enable remote Domain Registration and management of RAD WEB HOSTING domains.

## Installation
1. Download the module via the following [link](https://github.com/Rad-Web-Hosting/radwebhosting-blesta/releases/latest)
1. Copy the `radwebhosting` directory into the respective Blesta directory in your Blesta setup: `/installpath/components/modules/`
2. Visit Settings > Company > Modules > Available. Click the "Install" button within the radwebhosting module listing.
3. Enter your API username and API secret. These can be obtained via your [Hosting Dashboard](https://radwebhosting.com/client_area/clientarea.php).
4. Choose to pay via credit card. You must have one on file. This will ensure domains are registered/renewed when your WHMCS requests. If you do not want to use a credit card, you must have a credit balance on your account with RAD WEB HOSTING.
